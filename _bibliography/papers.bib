abstract  ="We report the development of a class of 3D-printed{,} configurable{,} paper-based organ-on-paper platforms where autonomous and continuous delivery of media to engineered microtissue models is readily achieved without requiring external electrical power during device operations. Here{,} a passive flow with well-controlled flow rates was initiated along the flow path by capillary and evaporation-driven forces. Cell types representing the vasculature (human umbilical vein endothelial cells){,} the liver (HepG2 hepatocyte-like cells){,} the tumor (A549 lung cancer cells){,} and the kidney (HK-2 kidney proximal tubular cells) were cultured in the different{,} pre-configured{,} 3D-printed organ-on-paper platforms. We adopted cisplatin and the prodrug capecitabine as model drugs{,} which exhibited varying cytotoxicity and metabolism-dependent efficacy outcomes in the various single- or multi-organ models demonstrated. These 3D-printed{,} configurable{,} paper-based{,} cost-effective{,} and autonomous multi-organ-on-paper platforms would enable convenient generation of shelf-storable organ-mimicking structures{,} allowing for point-of-care construction of high-content in vitro microphysiological systems to rapidly evaluate both on-target efficacies and/or off-target toxicities{,} for potential applications in preclinical drug screening and personalized therapeutic selection."}

abstract = {We report a method for expanding microchannel-embedded paper devices using a precisely controlled gas-foaming technique for the generation of volumetric tissue models in vitro. We successfully fabricated hollow, perfusable microchannel patterns contained in a densely entangled network of bacterial cellulose nanofibrils using matrix-assisted sacrificial three-dimensional printing, and demonstrated the maintenance of their structural integrity after gas-foaming-enabled expansion in an aqueous solution of NaBH4. The resulting expanded microchannel-embedded paper devices showed multilayered laminar structures with controllable thicknesses as a function of both NaBH4 concentration and expansion time. With expansion, the thickness and porosity of the bacterial cellulose network were significantly increased. As such, cellular infiltration was promoted comparing to as-prepared, non-expanded devices. This simple technique enables the generation of truly volumetric, cost-effective human-based tissue models, such as vascularized tumor models, for potential applications in preclinical drug screening and personalized therapeutic selection.}
