I am a Senior Research Programmer at the [Decision Science Center](https://egobiernoytp.tec.mx/es/investigacion/centro-decisiones) at Tecnológico de Monterrey’s School of Government and Public Transformation. My work focuses on applying data science and machine learning to support decision-making in climate action, urban development, and sustainable policy. I build predictive models, data pipelines, and simulations to analyze large-scale socio-economic and environmental datasets.

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I specialized in Machine Learning. During my graduate studies, I worked on a variety of projects, including machine learning applications and robotics systems that integrated deep learning for object detection and manipulation.

Before that, I worked as a Research Engineer at [IPICyT](https://www.ipicyt.edu.mx/), where I designed and deployed end-to-end data pipelines for air quality monitoring and predictive analytics. I applied regression modeling to calibrate sensor data and visualize pollution trends—laying the foundation for data-driven environmental assessments.

Earlier in my career, I conducted bioengineering research under Prof. [Yu Shrike Zhang](https://shrikezhang.com/) at Harvard Medical School, developing 3D printing methods and hydrogel-based tissue modeling tools for biomedical applications.

My work spans data science, machine learning, and software development, and I'm passionate about using these tools to solve complex social and environmental challenges. I’m currently focused on expanding my impact in data-driven policy, sustainability, and applied ML research.
